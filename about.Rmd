## About Me

<br>

My name is Robert Nall and I am the Director of Data Management at [nSide, Inc](https://www.nside.io/) in Florence, Alabama. On the side, I also teach courses with the [University of North Alabama Department of Geography](https://una.edu/geography/). I enjoy fishing, college football, and history. 

I have an MS in Geospatial Science from the [University of North Alabama](https://una.edu/geography/) and a BA in Geography from [Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/geosciences/). My background is in GIS, regional planning, natural resources, and education, but more recently in data science and technology.

I currently live in Florence, AL with my dog, Kiah.
